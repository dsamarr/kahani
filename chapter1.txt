crickets were hiding 
their sound was jumping around
it was a dark night sky ful of stars
moon was shining but not fully round

i  wondering in horrors of past 
from which i still bare the scars


weather is enjoying it self
so does mist by flying freely 

but the little fear of 
merging with soil 
filled  their heart with sorrow

there is infinite time in the world 
not for them to borrow

a gust of wind came
took mist to new heights
even if only for a while 
it gave mist a new life

wind snatched mist's sorrow


across the street lived a girl
